A Combinatorial Calculator implemented in JavaScript for mathematical calculations, displaying specific formula tables. Users can adjust parameters and select specific rows for computation. Additionally, there is an option to execute calculations for the entire table by clicking the "Compute All" button at the top of the table, providing results for the entire set of calculations.

### Requirements

input: integers n, r (m, k; or m, n) where 0<=r<=n (0<=k<=m-1; or 1<=n<=m, respectively ) 

output: 

(1) results of P(n, r), C(n, r), n^r, C(r+n-1, r) with respect to n, r; 

(2) the first n Catalan, triangular, harmonic, Fibonacci, Lucas with respect to n;

(3) Eulerian numbers with respect to m, k for 0<=k<=m-1 (i.e., a_sub(m,0), a_sub(m,1), ... , a_sub(m,m-1) ) and

(4) Stirling number of the second kind with respect to m, n for 1<=n<=m (i.e., S_sub(m,1), S_sub(m,2), ... , S_sub(m,n) )
